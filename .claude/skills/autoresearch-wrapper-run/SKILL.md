description: Start or resume a dependency-aware autoresearch-wrapper run in Git worktrees. Use when the target and metric are already configured and the user wants to initialize or continue the optimization loop.

# Autoresearch Wrapper Run

Use:

```bash
python3 scripts/autoresearch_wrapper.py run
```

When this skill is invoked:

1. Start or resume the current run.
2. If the run is blocked, explain whether the missing requirement is:
- target selection
- metric configuration
- execution settings
- dependency-aware readiness

3. If the run starts successfully, summarize:
- run id
- target part
- generated `program.md`
- seed worktree
- any preallocated candidates

4. Remind the user that the underlying loop uses:
- `allocate`
- `evaluate`
- `record`

## Example

- `/autoresearch-wrapper-run`
